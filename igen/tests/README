The following tests show the use of igen for each of the transport 
mechanisms.


/////////////////////////////
XDR tests:

client1/server1
	started by - typing "client1"
	igen template - test1.I
	socket connection - socket pair
	the client starts the server using RPCprocessCreate

client3/server3
	started by - typing "client1"
	igen template - test3.I
	socket connection - socket pair
	the client starts the server using RPCprocessCreate

xdrc_pvm/server_xdr
	started by - typing "server_xdr"
	igen template - xdr_link.I
	socket connection - socket pair for first client/server conneciton
    	                  - internet domain socket for rest
	note - pvmd3 must be running for this program to work
	the server starts a local client using RPCprocessCreate
        the local client queries the pvm virtual machine and starts
        xdrc_pvm on each machine in the virtual machine.  Due to 
        problems with Kerberos, this is only starting xdrc_pvm on the
        local machine.  The xdrc_pvm's started by the local client
        connect to the server via the "well known port" that is passed
        in on the command line.
