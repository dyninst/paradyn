// Sparc code sequences in shared libraries often contain something like:
//  call PC + 8
//  nop
// The function of such a sequence is to set the 07 register (a side effect 
//  of the call insn on the sparc arch) - this can be used e.g. to figure
//  out where the executing function has been loaded.
// When code is relocated, paradyn often wants the 07 the be set to value 
//  which it would have been set to if the code had NOT been relocated.
// One method (used in older paradyn releases) is to insert a call to the old
//  code, and also a call back from it (with an add in its delay slot).
// However, given that we know the locatiosn (virtual addresss) at which
//  both the origional code was loaded, and at which the relcoated code 
//  will be placed when we do the alterations, it seems that
//  a simpler solution is just to replace the original 
//    call PC + 8
//    nop
//  with a sequence which explicitly sets 07 to the address of the original
//   call:
//    setlo %07
//    sethi %07
