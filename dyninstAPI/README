This directory contains the Dyninst API library.  To make the library, type
"make install" in the subdirectory of this directory that is named after the
platform that on which you are building the library.  The library also depends
on code in the core/util and core/dyninstAPI_RT directories, so you will also
need to go into the appropriate platform subdirectories of these directories
and type "make install."  If you have built Paradyn, then the util library
will have already been built.

After the dyninstAPI_RT, util, and dyninstAPI libraries have been built and
installed, you can test them using the programs in core/dyninstAPI/tests.  See
the README file in that directory for information about the test programs.
