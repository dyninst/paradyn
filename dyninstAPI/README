This directory contains the Dyninst API library.  To make the library, type
"make install" in the subdirectory of this directory that is named after the
platform that on which you are building the library.  The library also depends
on code in the core/util and core/dyninstAPI_RT directories, so you will also
need to go into the appropriate platform subdirectories of these directories
and type "make install."  If you have built Paradyn, then the util library
will have already been built.

On Windows NT, before running make in the core/util/i386-unknown-nt4.0
directory, you will need to obtain and install ONC RPC for Windows NT.   See
the page http://set.gmd.de/~mfg/oncrpc.html for information about this
package.  The makefiles expect it to be installed in the directory C:\SUNRPC.

On platforms on which the API dynamically loads a run-time library into an
application's address space (Sparc Solaris and Windows NT), you must set
certain values in the environment so that it can locate the run-time library.
On the Sparc Solaris platform, you must set the DYNINSTAPI_RT_LIB environment
variable to the full pathname of the file libdyninstAPI_RT.so.1.  If you have
correctly set the PARADYN_ROOT and PLATFORM environment variables, then the
proper pathname is:

    $PARADYN_ROOT/lib/$PLATFORM/libdyninstAPI_RT.so.1

On Windows NT, you should put the directory %PARADYN_ROOT%/lib/%PLATFORM%
in your path.

After the dyninstAPI_RT, util, and dyninstAPI libraries have been built and
installed, you can test them using the programs in core/dyninstAPI/tests.  See
the README file in that directory for information about the test programs.
