This directory contains tests for the dyninstAPI library.

To build the test programs, cd into the subdirectory of this directory that
is named after the platform you are running on, and type "make."  If you are
using the source distribution of the Dyninst API, you will need to make the
API libraries before making the tests; see the README file in the
core/dyninstAPI directory for how to do this.

On all platforms except AIX, before you can run the test programs you will
need to set up your environment to use the Dyninst API library, as described
in the documentation and the README file in the directory above this one
(specifically, the DYNINSTAPI_RT_LIB environment variable should be set).

To run the tests, type "test1," "test2," "test3," or "test4" in the
subdirectory of this directory named after the platform you are using.  Each
test program starts a mutatee process, test?.mutatee, the executable for
which must be in the current directory.  For both programs, you should see a
series of messages saying that each test was passed.

The programs take two options:
    -verbose	Print extra output.
    -attach	Start the mutatee without using the library and then
		attach to it.

The test2 program tests to see that various error conditions are caught
and reported properly by the library, so it is normal for it to print some
warning and error messages.  If all tests pass, it will print a message
saying so, so you may assume any error messages printed were expected.
