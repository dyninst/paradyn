This directory contains tests for the dyninstAPI library.

Before you can build the test programs, you will need do a "make install"
in the following directories (relative to the top of the paradyn source
tree):

    core/util/$PLATFORM
    core/dyninstAPI_RT/$PLATFORM
    core/dyninstAPI/$PLATFORM

If you've made paradyn, then you'll already have the util library
installed.

Once you've made the above libraries, you can go into the $PLATFORM
subdirectory of the directory containing this README file and run make
there.

To run the tests, type "test1" or "test2" in the directory in which they
were made.  Each test program starts a mutatee process, test1.mutatee or
test2.mutatee, the executable for which must be in the current directory.
For both programs, you should see a series of messages saying that each
test was passed.

The programs take two options:
    -verbose	Print extra output.
    -attach	Start the mutatee without using the library and then
		attach to it.  This option is only supported on Solaris
		and Windows NT.

It is normal to see the messages "WARNING: register _n_ is still in use" and
"attempt to ptrace exited process," as well as the message "Process _n_
has terminated" when test1.mutatee exits.

The test2 program tests to see that various error conditions are caught
and reported properly by the library, so it is normal for it to print some
warning and error messages.  If all tests pass, it will print a message
saying so, so you may assume any error messages printed were expected.
