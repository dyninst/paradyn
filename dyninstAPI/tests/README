This directory contains tests for the dyninstAPI library.  The library
currently runs on the sparc-sun-solaris2.4, sparc-sun-sunos4.1.3,
rs6000-ibm-aix4.1 platforms, and i386-unknown-solaris2.5 platofrms.

Before you can build the test programs, you will need do a "make install"
in the following directories (relative to the top of the paradyn source
tree):

    core/util/$PLATFORM
    core/dyninstAPI_RT/$PLATFORM
    core/dyninstAPI/$PLATFORM

If you've made paradyn, then you'll already have the util library
installed.

Once you've made the above libraries, you can go into the $PLATFORM
subdirectory of the directory containing this README file and run make
there.

To run the tests, type "test1" in the directory in which they were made.
The test1 program starts test1.mutatee (which must be in the current
working directory when you run test1).  Test1 instruments test1.mutatee
and then lets it run to check that the results of the instrumentation were
as expected.

You should see a series of messages saying that tests 1-16 were passed.
If any messages saying "**Failed** test #n" appear then there is a problem
in the dyninstAPI library.

It is normal to see the messages "WARNING: register _n_ is still in use" and
"attempt to ptrace exited process," as well as the message "Process _n_
has terminated" when test1.mutatee exits.
