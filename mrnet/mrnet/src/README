TODO: optimize pdr routines (at least by inlining where appropriate)

New Details:
- Front end is now considered root of infrastructure since it can
  now do aggregations. It is an error if the root specified in the
  config file is not the host on which the frontend is run.

- "proc_newsubtree()" creates the internal nodes and the application backend in
  a single shot.
