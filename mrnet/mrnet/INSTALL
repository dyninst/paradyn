For this discussion, $MRNET_ROOT is the location of the top-level directory
of the MRNet distribution and $MRNET_ARCH is a string describing the platform
(OS and architecture) as discovered by autoconf. For all instructions, it is
assumed that the current working directory is $MRNET_ROOT. Complete updated
documentation may be found at http://www.paradyn.org/mrnet.

1. SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

  MRNet is designed to be a highly-portable system. This first version should
  build cleanly with GNU v3 compilers. We have built and successfully tested
  all MRNet components on:
    - Linux 2.4
    - Aix 5.1
    - Solaris 8

  We are currently upgrading our build system to allow the use of native
  compilers where appropriate, for instance, xlc and xlC in AIX environments. 

2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

  The third party tools that MRNet uses and needs for proper installation are: 
    - GNU make
    - flex
    - bison

3. Build Configuration

  MRNet uses GNU autoconf to discover the platform specific configuration
  parameters. The script that does this auto-configuration is called configure. 

    UNIX>  ./configure --help

  shows all possible options of the command. Below, we display the MRNet-specific
  ones: 

    --with-libfl                Link line for flex library
    --with-outputlevel          output level (0=>off, *1=>error*, 2=>info, 3=>lo-debug, 4=>mid-debug, 5=>hi-debug)

  ./configure without any options should give reasonable results, but the user
  may specify certain options. For example, 

    UNIX> ./configure CXX=g++ CXXFLAGS=-O3 -with-outputlevel=5 \
          --with-libfl=/usr/local/lib/libfl.a

  instructs the configure script to use g++ for the C++ compiler with level 3
  optimization, very verbose output and /usr/local/lib/libfl.a as the location of
  the flex library. 

4. Compilation and Installation

  To build the MRNet toolkit by type: 

    UNIX>  make

  After a successful build, the following files will be present: 
  $MRNET_ROOT/lib/$MRNET_ARCH/libmrnet.a: MRNet API library
  $MRNET_ROOT/bin/$MRNET_ARCH/mrnet_commnode: MRNet internal communcation node (used internally)
  $MRNET_ROOT/bin/$MRNET_ARCH/mrnet_topgen: MRNet topology file generator
  $MRNET_ROOT/bin/$MRNET_ARCH/*_[FE,BE]: MRNet test front-end and back-end programs
