1. OVERVIEW

  MRNet is a customizable, high-performance software infrastructure for
  building scalable tools and applications.  It supports efficient 
  multicast and data aggregation functionality using a tree of processes 
  between the tool's front-end and back-ends.  MRNet-based tools may use 
  these internal processes to distribute many important tool activities, 
  for example to reduce data analysis time and keep tool front-end loads 
  manageable.

  MRNet-based tool components communicate across logical channels called
  streams. At MRNet internal processes, filters are bound to these streams to
  synchronize and aggregate dataflows. Using filters, MRNet can efficiently
  compute averages, sums, and other more complex aggregations and analyses
  on tool data. MRNet also supports facilities that allow tool developers
  dynamically load new tool-specific filters into the system.

  Features:
    * Flexible tool organization: MRNet does not dictate the organization of
      MRNet and tool processes, so MRNet-based tools can tailor MRNet's
      configuration to the requirements of the tool and its target environment.

    * Scalable, flexible data aggregation:  MRNet provides a set of built-in
      filters for traditional data aggregation operations like averages, sums,
      and data concatenation.  MRNet also supports custom, dynamically-loaded
      filters for tool-specific aggregations.

    * High-bandwidth communication: Internally, MRNet transfers data using an 
      efficient, packed binary representation. Zero-copy data paths are used 
      whenever possible to reduce data transfer latency.
    
    * Scalable multicast: MRNet supports efficient multicast to reduce the cost
      of delivering tool control messages to tool back-ends.

    * Multiple concurrent data channels: MRNet supports multiple logical
      channels of data between tool components. Multiple aggregation and
      multicast operations may be in progress simultaneously.

    * Open source licensing.
