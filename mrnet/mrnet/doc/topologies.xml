Topologies</title>
MRNet allows a tool to specify a node allocation and process connectivity tailored to its computation and communication requirements and to the system running the tool. Choosing an appropriate MRNet configuration can be difficult due to the complexity of the tool's own activity and its interaction with the system. We briefly discuss the issues related to process layout, but because our current work focuses on tool scalability a full treatment of optimal MRNet configurations is beyond the scope of this paper. The configurations we used for our experiments in Section 4 were chosen for their ability to show MRNet's effect on tool scalability. We anticipate future research will examine the issue of MRNet configurations in more detail.
When choosing the process configuration for an MRNet-based tool, there are two key issues to consider: whether the MRNet internal processes are co-located with the application processes under study, and how the internal processes are connected. Our primary measures of a configuration's quality are its: (1) latency for a single broadcast operation, measured from initiation by the front-end to the last receipt by a back-end; (2) latency for a single data aggregation operation, measured from initiation by the back-ends to receipt by the front-end; (3) throughput for streams of broadcasts and data aggregations; and (4) CPU utilization of the MRNet internal processes.
