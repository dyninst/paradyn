paradynd process could not be started, or that it might have died.  This 
error should be considered an indication of a bug in the tool.
%Y

%N 2
%E Data for unknown metric id
%A dm
%S serious
%X
Data has arrived from a paradynd process for an unknown metric id.  This is
a serious error that indicates a bug in the paradyn/paradynd interface.
%Y

%N 3
%E Unable to find metric component for sample.
%A dm
%S serious
%X
A sample value has arrive for a metric from a paradynd, but the paradyn 
process was not expecting a value from this process.  This is a serious internal
consistancy failure of the paradyn/paradynd interface.
%Y

%N 4
%E unable to connect to new paradyn daemon process.
%A paradynd
%S serious
%X
A request had arrived to start a new paradyn daemon process on a remote 
machine (either from the user or the system based on adding new hosts), and
the paradyn user process was unable to rendezvous with the paradynd process.
This could indicate a network failure, the paradynd process not being 
installed on the remote machine, or a file permission problem.
%Y

%N 5
%E paradynd process has died
%A paradynd
%S information

a network failure, a host failure, or a bug in the paradyd process.
%Y

%N 6
%E unable to start paradynd
%A dm
%S information
%X
A request to start a new application process on a machine required that a new
paradyn daemon process be started on that machine.  The attempt to start that
new paradyd process failed.  This is a continuable error, but does mean that
the request application process will NOT be started.  This error can happen
if the path for the paradynd is incorrect, if the paradynd binary is not
installed on that machine, or if the machine or network is down.
