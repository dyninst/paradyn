process was not expecting a value from this process.  This is a serious internal

%E unable to connect to new paradyn daemon process.
%A paradynd
%S serious
%X
A request had arrived to start a new paradyn daemon process on a remote 
machine (either from the user or the system based on adding new hosts), and
the paradyn user process was unable to rendezvous with the paradynd process.
This could indicate a network failure, the paradynd process not being 
installed on the remote machine, or a file permission problem.

paradyn daemon process be started on that machine.  The attempt to start that
new paradyd process failed.  This is a continuable error, but does mean that
the request application process will NOT be started.  This error can happen
if the path for the paradynd is incorrect, if the paradynd binary is not
installed on that machine, or if the machine or network is down.
