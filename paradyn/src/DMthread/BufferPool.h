/*
 * Using a BufferPool:
 *
 * 1) producer calls alloc() to obtain a buffer to work with, passing
 *    a desired buffer size (num-entries)
 * 2) producer fills this buffer as desired
 * 3) producer hands the (pointer to) buffer off to the consumer.
 *    note: the producer must _never_ use the buffer after this point!!!
 * 4) the consumer consumes the buffer as desired
 * 5) the consumer calls dealloc() on the (pointer to) buffer.
 *    note: now the consumer must _never_ use the buffer after this point!!!
