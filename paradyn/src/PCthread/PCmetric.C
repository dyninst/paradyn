 here we assume that data continues flowing for all enabled metric/focus
 pairs unless (a) some drastic error renders a met/focus pair uncollectible or
 (b) a process exits.  In other words, if data is not received for a given 
 metric instance for some relatively short period of time, we will mark that 
 PC metric as uncollectible and stop testing the subscribing experiment(s)
