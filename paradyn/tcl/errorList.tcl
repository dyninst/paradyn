# Error message format:
# set pdError(1) { -> Error number 
#
# { Default error message -> Error message to be displayed when "" is received
#			     as a parameter. Detailed information such as
# 			     specific filenames will be displayed only if this
#			     information was included as part of the error
#			     message
# } {source -> Indicates where the error comes from. "source" can be:
#	       paradynd = paradyn daemon
#	       pc = performance consultant
#	       dm = data manager
#	       vi = visi interface 
#	       vm = visi manager
#	       ui = user interface
# } {error type -> information, warning, serious, fatal
# } {
# Explanation -> Detailed explanation of the error and possible actions to be
#		 taken by the user
# }}
#
# Call example: 
# 	showErrorCallback(27, "Executable file /p/paradyn/weird not found");
#

# COMMENT: the "information" error type doesn't actually correspond to an
# error at all, but rather an informational message which is handled in a
# rather similar way (though differentiated in how they are presented).
# NOTE: many former "information" messages have been re-typed "warning"s.

# NOTE: the default explanations should generally _not_ have a newline in them.
# The tk text widget will word wrap just fine on its own.  Putting in explicit
# newlines forces a line break at certain points in the text widget---and who's
# to say that it will be in the right place since the user can resize the
# error dialog box to different widths?

# IMPORTANT:  if you add/delete an error, change the error count in
#             getNumPdErrors at the end of this file

{information}
{Paradyn is a tool for measuring and analyzing the performance of\
parallel and distributed programs. Paradyn can measure large, long\
running programs and provides facilities for helping to automatically\
find performance problems in parallel programs. Paradyn operates on\
executable (a.out or .exe) files by dynamically inserting measurement\
code while the program is running. Paradyn can measure programs running\
on Solaris (SPARC and x86), Linux (x86), Irix (MIPS), WindowsNT (x86),\
AIX (Power2) and SP2, or heterogeneous combinations of these systems.\
Paradyn can also handle MPI and PVM on these platforms.

{Internal error: procedure main cannot be instrumented.}

{fatal error}
{Paradyn could not find or instrument procedure main. One possible explanation\
is that main has a jump to the middle of the instrumentation that Paradyn\
needs to insert. To avoid this, you can try to move any loops at the beginning\
of main to some other place. A future release will fix this problem.}
