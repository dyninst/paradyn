This directory contains the source code for tcl visis.  

tabVis.tcl -- Tabular display of paradyn data.  tabVis displays 
             performance data for all requested resources and metrics.  
             Users may control the behavior and appearance of the table 
             with menu selections. 
             
barChart.tcl -- Bar chart display of paradyn data.  Currently limited
                to a single metric, but may have several resources.
		Currently written entirely in tk/tcl; future versions
		will probably be part c++ since blt_barchart has
		some performance and interface problems...
