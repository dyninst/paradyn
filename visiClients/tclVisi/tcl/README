tabVis.tcl -- Tabular display of paradyn data.  tabVis displays 
             performance data for all requested resources and metrics.  
             Users may control the behavior and appearance of the table 
             with menu selections.

barChart.tcl -- Bar chart display of paradyn data.  Currently limited
                to a single metric, but may have several resources.
		Currently written entirely in tk/tcl; future versions
		will probably be part c++ since blt_barchart has
		some performance and interface problems...

phaseTable.tcl -- A tabular display of paradyn phase data.  displays phase
		  start, stop, and name information for all phases that 
		  exist in the system as well as providing a mechanism to
		  define a new phase.
