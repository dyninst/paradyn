This directory contains the source code for tclVisi, a tcl interface
to the visi library.  The visi library is a C++ interface to paradyn
data (see ../../visi).  

To use tclVisi, a programmer writes a tcl application and makes calls
to DataGrid (or Dg) procedures.  The Dg procedures allow a tcl
application to get information about metrics, resources, and data
values.

Subdirectories:
  src -- source code for tclVisi
  tcl -- code for tcl applications
  ${PLATFORM} -- platform specific binaries and makefiles
