This directory contains the source code for paradyn visualization
clients.  Each subdirectory corresponds to a different visi.

Visis so far:

  tclVisi -- A tcl interface for the visi interface that allows 
             programmers to use Paradyn performance data in tcl 
             applications.  See the tclVisi/tcl directory for 
             example tcl visis.

  rthist -- A realtime (i.e. dynamically updated) time plot visi.
            Written to use the X toolkit and Athena widgets.
            <THIS NEEDS TO BE INSTALLED>

  barchart -- A dynamically updated barChart of metric/focus pairs.
              Written in tcl (as much as possible) and C++ (when
              speed matters most--new data callbacks).  Bars
              are drawn with Xlib and use double-buffering.
              Especially efficient when run remotely (so X server
              can handle the double-buffering); even when run
              locally, perturbation is probably acceptable.
              Many bars can fit on the screen since the resources
              are drawn on the y axis, meaning labels can fit
              efficiently without having to be rotated 90 degress.
