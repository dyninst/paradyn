 * This commit fully changes the class name of "vector" to "pdvector".
 *
 * A nice upshot is the removal of a bunch of code previously under the flag
 * USE_STL_VECTOR, which is no longer necessary in many cases where a
 * functional difference between common/h/Vector.h and stl::vector was
 * causing a crash.
 *
 * Generally speaking, Dyninst and Paradyn now use pdvector exclusively.
 * This commit DOES NOT cover the USE_STL_VECTOR flag, which will now
 * substitute stl::vector for BPatch_Vector only.  This is currently, to
 * the best of my knowledge, only used by DPCL.  This will be updated and
 * tested in a future commit.
 *
 * The purpose of this, again, is to create a further semantic difference
 * between two functionally different classes (which both have the same
 * [nearly] interface).
 *
 * Revision 1.10  2002/04/09 18:06:42  mjbrim
