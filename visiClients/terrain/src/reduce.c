/*********************************************************************
* reduce -- reduce a plot to a new one with fewer points (in its x-axis).
*           The value of the new points are the average of the value of
*           the points between the med-potints of it and its adjacent
*           points.
*
* Parameters:
*   new_surface:  The reduced plot.
*   surface:      The plot to be reduced (not changed).
*   new_size:     Size of the reduced plot.  This is only a "suggestion".
*                 The actually size of the new plot will be somewhere 
*                 between new_size and new_size * 2.
*
* Bugs:
*   Assumed new_surface is defined and there are points associated to it.
*   new_surface and surface cannot be the same object.
